## Assignment Overview
What is the assignment about?  
The assignment involves creating and implementing functions for a graph data structure. The program reads a graph from a file and provides several operations to interact with the graph, such as adding edges, displaying the adjacency list, and other tasks related to graph representation and manipulation. This helps in understanding core concepts of data structures and algorithms involving graphs.

**main.c**: This file provides an interface to interact with the graph through various functions, such as displaying the adjacency list, performing breadth-first Search, etc.

**graph_functions.c**: This file includes functions to create the graph, add edges, and manage memory. The logic for manipulating and interacting with the graph data structure is implemented here.

**graph.h**: This header file contains the declarations for the functions and data structures used in graph_functions.c.
